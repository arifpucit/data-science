It is a common misconception that the law of large numbers dictates that if, say, five heads have been flipped in a row, then the probability of tails is higher on the sixth flip. In fact, probability theory holds that each coin flip is completely independent of all others. Thus, every single flip of a fair coin has a 50% chance of being heads, no matter what happened on preceding flips."

    "\n",
    "- Together, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are called the **model coefficients**. To create a model, we must \"learn\" the values of these coefficients. And once we've learned these coefficients, we can use the model to predict! Our objective is to find the parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize $\\epsilon$ across all the available data points. "
