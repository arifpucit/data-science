    "| **^**     |Caret symbol specifies that the match must start at the beginning of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline<br>- `^b` will check if the string starts with 'b' such as baba, boss, basic, b, by, etc.<br>- `^si` will check if the string starts with 'si' such as simple, sister, si, etc.\n",
    "| **$**     |Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the string <br> - `s$` will check for the string that ends with a such as geeks, ends, s, etc.<br>- `ing$` will check for the string that ends with ing such as going, seeing, ing, etc.\n",
    "| **.**     |Represent a single occurrance of any character except new line <br> - `a.b` will check for the string that contains any character at the place of the dot such as acb, acbd, abbb, etc<br> - `..` will check if the string contains at least 2 characters\n",
    "| **\\\\**    |Used to drop special meaning of a character following it or used to refer to a special character. <br> - Since dot `(.)` is a metacharacter, so if you want to search it in a string you have to use the backslash `(\\)` just before the dot `(.)`  so that it will lose its specialty. \n",
