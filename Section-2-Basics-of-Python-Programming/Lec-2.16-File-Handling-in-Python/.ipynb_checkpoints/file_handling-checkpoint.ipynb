    "## 1. What are Files, and Why we need them?\n",
    "- An important component of an operating system is its files and directories. A file is a location on disk that stores related information and has a name. We use files to organize our data in different directories on a hard-disk.\n",
    "- The RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile; it holds data only as long as it is up. So, we use files to store data permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Types\n",
    "- Python supports two types of files (Binary files and Text files):\n",
    "    - **Binary Files:** All binary files follow a specific format. We can open some binary files in the normal text editor, but we cannot read the content present in the file. This is because the binary files are encoded in a specific format. So for handling binary files we need applications that understand the specific format of that binary file. Most of the files that we see in our computer systems are binary files. Some examples are:\n",
    "        - **Document Files:** .pdf, .doc, .xls, etc\n",
    "        - **Image Files:** .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp, etc\n",
    "        - **Audio Files:** .mp3, .wav, .mka, .aac, etc\n",
    "        - **Video Files:** .mp4, .3gp, .mkv, .avi, etc\n",
    "        - **Database Files:** .mdb, .accde, .frm, .sqlite, etc\n",
    "        - **Archive Files:** .zip, .gzip, .rar, .tar, .iso, .7z, etc\n",
    "        - **Executable Files:** .exe, .dll, .elf, .class, etc\n",
    "    - **Text Files:** Text files do not have any specific encoding and can be opened in a normal text editor. Text files are mostly structured as a sequence of lines, where each line includes a sequence of characters. Every line in a file terminates with a special character known as EOL or end of line. Some examples are:\n",
    "        - **Document Files:** .txt, .tex, .rtf, etc\n",
    "        - **Source Codes:** .c, .cpp, .js, .py, .java, etc\n",
    "        - **Web Standards:** .html, .xml, .css, .json, etc\n",
    "        - **Tabular Data:** .csv, .tsv, etc\n",
    "        - **Configuration Files:** .ini, .cfg, .reg, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "### File Handling in Python\n",
    "For file handling there are four important operations that can be handled by Python on files:\n",
    " - open\n",
    " - read\n",
    " - write\n",
    " - close\n",
    " \n",
    "There are other file operations as well e.g., deleting a file, renaming a file, appending data to file, copying a file, changing properties of file. However, CRUD operations are basic file handling operations."
